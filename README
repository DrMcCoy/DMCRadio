==========================================
          (Friday, 31.12.2004)

[NOTE: DMCRadio is over 10 years old now. It's buggy, ugly, pretty
embarrasing and probably damn near useless by now. It's only
provided here for historical reasons. Don't hope for any support.
You are, however, free to laugh at the code.]

DMCRadio is a ncurses-based console program for radio tuner cards
supported by the Video4Linux system. It's like the 'radio' program
by Gerd Knorr and Juli Merino, but much better (I hope...).
It also features a recording function.
NEW: should work on FreeBSD now! (thanks to Vladimir Kushnir)

Requirements
------------

To run DMCRadio, you'll need a kernel with Video4Linux support. 
Beside, you'll need the ncurses-package.
And DMCRadio is only usefull with a radio-card (or a tv-card with
radio-tuner)

Installation
------------

1. Untar the source archive
2. ./configure
3. make
4. make install
5. Make sure, everybody can access your radiodevice (usually /dev/radio)

Usage
-----

-h	--help			Show help page and exit
-m	--mute			Mute and exit
-r dev	--radiodev dev		Set Radiodevice to dev [/dev/radio]
-m dev	--mixerdev dev		Set Mixerdevice to dev [/dev/mixer]
-d dev	--dspdev dev		Set DSPdevice to dev [/dev/dsp]
-v	--version		Print version and exit

Keyboard Controls
-----------------

1,2,3...9,0	jump to Preset Stations 1 - 10
shift+[1...9,0]	jump to Preset Stations 11 - 20
UP Key		tune 0.05 MHz up
DOWN Key	tune 0.05 MHz down
LEFT Key	previous volumecontrol
RIGHT Key	next volumecontrol
>		increase volume
<		decrease volume
m		mute
d		denoiser (mutes radio "between" two stations)
l		show mixerlabels instead of names
		(e.g. "PhoneIn" instead of "phin")
g		go to a frequency
x		exit
ESC, q, e	mute and exit
f		runtime fontchanger
  - UP Key	  next font
  - DOWN Key	  previous font
c		runtime colorchanger
  - UP Key	  next window
  - DOWN Key	  previous window
  - f		  cycle foreground color
  - b		  cycle background color
  - o		  toggle bold
i		shows some details about your radio-card
r		record
  - LEFT Key	  previous volumecontrol
  - RIGHT Key	  next volumecontrol
  - >		  increase volume
  - <		  decrease volume
  - a		  auto-adjust (reduces volume on overruns)
  - SPACE	  start/stop recording
  - n		  next file (same as typing space really really fast twice)
  - s		  toggle mono/stereo
  - r		  toggle between 11025Hz, 22050Hz and 44100Hz
  - m		  change maximal filesize
		  (accepts for example "110.42MB", "1000", "143kb")
+		next helppage		\ Whenever there are + and - signs
-		previous helppage	/ in the keys-window

The current config is saved to this config-file on exit.
