==========================================
          (Friday, 31.12.2004)

DMCRadio is a ncurses-based console program for radio tuner cards
supported by the Video4Linux system. It's like the 'radio' program
by Gerd Knorr and Juli Merino, but much better (I hope...).
It also features a recording function.
NEW: should work on FreeBSD now! (thanks to Vladimir Kushnir)

Requirements
------------

To run DMCRadio, you'll need a kernel with Video4Linux support. 
Beside, you'll need the ncurses-package.
And DMCRadio is only usefull with a radio-card (or a tv-card with
radio-tuner)

Installation
------------

1. Untar the source archive
2. ./configure
3. make
4. make install
5. Make sure, everybody can access your radiodevice (usually /dev/radio)

Usage
-----

-h	--help			Show help page and exit
-m	--mute			Mute and exit
-r dev	--radiodev dev		Set Radiodevice to dev [/dev/radio]
-m dev	--mixerdev dev		Set Mixerdevice to dev [/dev/mixer]
-d dev	--dspdev dev		Set DSPdevice to dev [/dev/dsp]
-v	--version		Print version and exit

shift+[1...9,0]	jump to Preset Stations 11 - 20
UP Key		tune 0.05 MHz up
DOWN Key	tune 0.05 MHz down
LEFT Key	previous volumecontrol
RIGHT Key	next volumecontrol
>		increase volume

Money
-----

I'm going to school and I'm getting only a few bucks from my parents. So I
always need money. You don't have to send me some, but if you have too much
and want to send me money, I won't stop you ;-). Drop me a line
(SvHe_TM@gmx.de) and I'll give you my address. But:
1. Please don't send coins. The Money could get stolen.
2. I would my thankful for Euros, but US-Dollars are okay, too. Please no 
   "strange" currency like money from Afrika or something. There are high
   exchange fees.
3. Please, please don't spam one of my mailboxes (email and snail mail).
