Thursday 12.02.2004 (Version 1.1.2)
    - fixed segfault if there's no ~/.DMCRadiorc (Thanks to Roberto De Leo)

Wednesday 28.01.2004 (Version 1.1.1)
  - fixed wrong version numbers (Thanks to Martin Jansa)
  - now the radio_getaudiomode function first checks for ASTEREO
    (if AMONO and ASTEREO is set, the radio is most likely in stereo mode)
    (Thanks to Martin Jansa)

Sunday 28.12.2003 (Version 1.1.0)
  - dropped that stupid color-struct
    (now using a window- and a windowfunctions-struct)
  - code cleanup (=> a bit less messy)
  - added record-function
  - added a mutex (ncurses is not really thread-safe)
  - volumecontrol changeable during runtime
  - the preset stations are now accessible through 1,2,3...9,0 and
    shift+[1,2,3...9,0]. This is more "logical" due to the keyboard-layout
