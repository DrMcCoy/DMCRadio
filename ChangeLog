Friday 31.12.2004 (Version 1.1.4)
  - different (more correctly) behaviour on different terminalsizes:
    - smaller than 80x24: refuses to start
    - 80x24: doesn't show the scroller (and won't start a scrollthread)
    - 80x25: "normal" view
    - greater than 80x25: centers
  - should now evaluate autoconf's PREFIX-variable
    (eg. expects the fonts in $PREFIX/share/DMCRadio/ - default is still
    /usr/local/share/DMCRadio/)
  - the fonts are there again (forgot to include them in version 1.1.3)
  - "make install" now installs the fonts in $PREFIX/share/DMCRadio/
  - added a "debian"-directory, you may build debian-packeges with
    "dpkg-buildpackage" now (after applying the patch (diff))
  - added standard header define stuff in the headers

Saturday 18.12.2004 (Version 1.1.3)
  - thanks to Vladimir Kushnir, DMCRadio should work under FreeBSD(-CURRENT) now

Thursday 12.02.2004 (Version 1.1.2)
  - fixed segfault if there's no ~/.DMCRadiorc (Thanks to Roberto De Leo)

Wednesday 28.01.2004 (Version 1.1.1)
  - fixed wrong version numbers (Thanks to Martin Jansa)
  - now the radio_getaudiomode function first checks for ASTEREO
    (if AMONO and ASTEREO is set, the radio is most likely in stereo mode)
    (Thanks to Martin Jansa)

Sunday 28.12.2003 (Version 1.1.0)
  - dropped that stupid color-struct
    (now using a window- and a windowfunctions-struct)
  - code cleanup (=> a bit less messy)
  - added record-function
  - added a mutex (ncurses is not really thread-safe)
  - volumecontrol changeable during runtime
  - the preset stations are now accessible through 1,2,3...9,0 and
    shift+[1,2,3...9,0]. This is more "logical" due to the keyboard-layout
  - fixed some typos in the "documentation" (README + manpage)

Friday 28.02.2003 (Version 1.0.2)
  - fixed possible security holes (strcpy --> strncpy)
  - deleted stupid functions in radiodev.c,
    replaced them with global variables
  - fixed some stupid things

Thursday 18.07.2002 (Version 1.0.1)
  - Added Feature "denoiser" (Thanks to Michael Rauen)

Monday 30.06.2002 (Version 1.0.0)
  - First Release
