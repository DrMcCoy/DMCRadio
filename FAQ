Q: DMCRadio says "Can't open /dev/mixer: No such device", but my souncard
   is working with other programs!
A: DMCRadio uses linux/souncard.h, an OSS-header. If you're using ALSA, you
   have to use the OSS-emulation-modules (snd_mixer_oss for general use and
   snd_pcm_oss if you want to record something).

Q: Why don't you add recording in mp3 (ogg, etc...)?
A: I think it's quite useless because when you record from radio,
   you've always got some moderator-guy or some advertising
   before/in between/after the stuff you wanted to record. So
   you would have to decompress the recording and cut the unwanted
   things out and because mp3/ogg/... are lossy, that wouldn't only
   be a waste of time but also of quality.
